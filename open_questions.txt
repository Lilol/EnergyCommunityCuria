TO DISCUSS:
Should the ProcessingPipeline automatically put a writer at the end of the pipeline? (Same question for saving the data into the DataStore)
How to handle unit systems, power vs. energy? Use an elaborate unit system toolbox or something simpler is enough? -> dataset.attrs["units"] = "deg C"

TODO:
MultiStepCalculation into a Calculator, because now it is a pipeline stage
