TO DISCUSS:
Should the ProcessingPipeline automatically put a writer at the end of the pipeline? (Same question for saving the data into the DataStore)
How to handle unit systems, power vs. energy? Use an elaborate unit system toolbox or something simpler is enough? -> dataset.attrs["units"] = "deg C"
How to handle time resolution: there is a given resolution and a desired one. How to differentiate? When do we convert between them?

TODO:
AggregateOnTimeResolution: process weird time resolutions, like season
Target SC evaluation should work for SS and other targets too, set the targets from config -> On it
Clear up predefined input and output types for Calculator classes
Create a common baseclass for all classes implementing self-registration
MultiStepCalculation into a Calculator, because now it is a pipeline stage
_parameter_calculators in 'Evaluator' classes should be automatically initialized
__call__ and calculate in Calculator classes: what's the difference? Only one???
